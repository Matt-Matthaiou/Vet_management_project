# Fake Vet Management

Fake Vet Management is a management app for a vet clinic which I made as my week project when learning Python and Flask. It uses Python, HTML, CSS, Psql and Python Flask technologies.

## Installation 

1. In order to run you will need to have Python3 installed along with Flask and psycopg2.
2. Please create a SQL database called fake_vet and run the fake_vet.sql to create the tables.
3. on the main directory simply run on terminal:
```bash
flask run
```
4. The default port is http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You will need to copy paste that on your google chrome.
